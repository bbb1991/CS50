For compile C source in mac, we nned to open terminal and type:
	gcc <file_name>
and then type:
	./a.out

Yeah, of course, we can type like:
	gcc <file_name>.c -o <compiled_file_name>
and type:
	./<compiled_file_name>

But I don't want edit .gitignore file all the time, yeah, I know, I'm so lazy...
